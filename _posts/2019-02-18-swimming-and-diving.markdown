Despite it being the dead of winter, swimming and diving is underway in Mt. Lebanon and is being led by several star senior athletes including University of Kentucky commit Trinity Ward, West Virginia commit Owen Johns and Bucknell commit Sophia Donati. These three Lebo athletes are preparing to take their talents to the collegiate level.

The swimming and diving teams have already gone head to head with schools like North Allegheny and Moon and have attended the Bucknell New Years Challenge at Bucknell University. Many important meets still remain, including WPIALs and States. Many swimmers and divers, like Ward, Johns and Donati, are trying to propel the team to better records and also set their own.

 Ward is currently ranked third in the state and finished first in several of her events this season including the 100 yard freestyle at the Bucknell New Years Challenge and had a season best time of 24.01 seconds in the 50 yard women’s freestyle during Mt. Lebanon’s meet at Moon this past December. Ward’s work ethic and time she puts into competitive swimming is why she gets to compete with the elite in the Southeastern Conference.
 
“[Practice] is about 16 and a half hours a week,” Ward said. “You practice every day after school for two hours, then Saturday morning for two hours and then [lift] three times a week for an hour and a half in the morning.”

Ward’s hard work and dedication factored into her decision to commit to Kentucky despite also being in contact with Duke and several Ivy League schools. Despite her being one of the top swimmers in Pennsylvania, a nagging back injury has been holding Ward back this season, but she has been seeking help throughout the area and around the country.

“I have been having some pain in my lower back, so I took off time at the beginning of this year, a lot more than I normally would, but now things are pretty good,” Ward said. “I go out to the Legacy Medical Center and do physical therapy, acupuncture and dry needling, and even though it takes up time, it’s worth it.”

This injury is not holding her back from making a future splash in the Kentucky Wildcats program and is making her a stronger person and a stronger swimmer as well. Kentucky swimming head coach Lars Jorgensen believes that Ward will impact the team drastically and provide that last missing piece to help win a Southeastern Conference title.

“I think she will have an immediate impact on our team both individually and on relays,” Jorgensen said. “Her attitude will continue to help our team culture as we strive to get to the next level.”

Jorgensen has had quite the success at Kentucky and bringing at top notch recruit like Ward to their program will make the team, Ward and the coaching staff better.

Another senior swimmer, Sophia Donati, is looking forward to the experiences ahead of her as she gets ready to head to the Patriot League powerhouse in Bucknell University, but the whole recruiting process was not easy. In the end, Bucknell’s leadership and teamwork was superior to those of other schools she looked at including University of Delaware, Duquesne and George Washington.

“The team there was very close, and it showed during my visit. It really meant a lot to me to fit in with the team dynamics and be a contributing factor to the team’s success,” Donati said.

Donati set a personal best with a 24.36 second time in the 50 yard freestyle this past December and is currently ranked top 50 in the state. 

“With the opportunity of new training skills, I really hope I can keep improving and reach the peak of my swimming by the end of my four years there,” Donati said.

Bucknell is anticipating that Donati will put in the work and hours that will help them be successful. The coaching staff and Head Coach Dan Schinnerer knows that Donati made the right decision by choosing Bucknell over other schools.

“We believe she is someone who can have a strong impact on the team right away,” Schinnerer said. “She is versatile across a range of freestyle events from the 50 to the 500.”

Drifting away from the swimming category, the Mt. Lebanon diving program is sending star diver Owen Johns to the University of West Virginia. Johns was a WPIAL runner up last season but has his eyes on the prize this season. Johns was looking at several other colleges besides West Virginia but ultimately thought that being a Mountaineer was the best choice for him.

“Yeah, I was actually talking to Pitt and Penn State for diving, and I train at Pitt right now, so I didn’t want anything too familiar,” Johns said. “I wanted a new experience and Penn State just wasn’t the right fit for me and WVU just threw their offer at me.”

Johns has had an amazing experience with the Mt. Lebanon diving program and thanks his past coaches and teammates as he continues his journey in the diving field. Johns knows why West Virginia chose him to be their next big diver and he is ready to put in the work and time it takes to be the next Mountaineer legend.

“I feel like the kind of diver West Virginia is getting is someone that will work extremely hard all the time and is going to put in 110 percent effort in everything they do,” Johns said.
