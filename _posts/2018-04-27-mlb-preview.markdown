It’s that time of year again! It was a long five months, but baseball is finally back. All 30 teams are off to a fresh start, and the league’s superstars are ready to continue their success alongside new recruits.

With help from eighth grader Jonathan Dietrich and sophomores Willjack Siyman and Adam Miller, the upcoming season will broken down to deliver all of the information you need as the season commences. Let’s start with the best teams in the league and who will hold up through the year.

“The New York Yankees will finish with the best record in baseball this season,” Siyman said. “They have the most skilled players in Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and Gary Sanchez.”

The Bronx Bombers have huge potential to be successful in 2018. With two 50 home-run-hitters in the lineup now with Judge and Stanton, it will be hard to see any pitcher rack up strikeouts against these superstars. They also have a solid starting rotation and bullpen highlighted by Luis Severino and Dellin Betances as their top pitchers. This team will have some tough competition in their division with another huge contender ahead of them in the Boston Red Sox.

“New York Mets will win the NL because they have an easy division and a good balance of skilled young players and elite veterans,” Dietrich said.

The Mets’ only true contender in their division this season will most likely be the Washington Nationals, but the Mets could have something special brewing with their postseason experience in the recent years. The front office of the Mets did a great job bringing in veterans like Todd Frazier and also keeping young stars like pitchers Noah Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom. Watch out for the Mets to be a big sleeper team this upcoming season.

Now moving onto to the Most Valuable Player watch. The same big name guys have been named as contenders every fall the past three years, and some players are looking for more hardware on their shelf.

“Bryce Harper will win the NL MVP,” Siyman said. “He is a great team leader and a power hitter.”

The Nationals star is coming off of another career year with 24 home runs and 89 RBIs. The crazy thing is Harper is only 25 years old. With this much ahead of him he has the potential to rack up more numbers.

“I think Mike Trout will win the AL MVP,” Miller said.

Mike Trout is another one of the league’s top superstars and has led the Los Angeles Angels in most categories throughout his whole career. He tallied 33 home runs and 72 RBI last season. Trout finished top five in MVP voting again last season so why not do it again? He has already brought in two MVP awards (2014 and 2016) in his short career and has a lot more ahead of him with the Angels. 

Now let’s find out who these three guys will take home the Fall Classic title.

“The World Series will be the Yankees vs. Diamondbacks with the Yankees winning in six games,” Miller said.

The Arizona Diamondbacks are a team chock full of talent led by all star first baseman Paul Goldschmidt and former Cy Young winning pitcher, Zack Greinke. The Yankees were made to be contenders with the star players they have and haven’t had this big of a chance to make it since Derek Jeter played. This would be an amazing World Series if everything plays out in the predictions favor.

The New York Yankees will play the Atlanta Braves with the Yankees taking home the title,” Siyman said.

The Braves are in an easier NL East division and have their eyes on the prize. This locked and loaded team is led by All-Stars Ender Inciarte and Freddie Freeman as they try and help the younger players towards success. If this did in fact happen the Yankees would probably have a clean sweep on this team made for the future.

“Cubs in the NL, Red Sox in the AL, that will be the 2018 World Series,” Dietrich stated.

The Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox are two teams that are made for now and are filled with All-Star players and coaches. 

As we jump into the the MLB season, keep these predictions in mind. This season will for sure be filled with lots of excitement and momentum from all 30 baseball clubs. Yes, some of these predictions are bold, but anything can happen during the 162 game season. It’s going to be a long season but for any baseball lover it will be  paradise.
