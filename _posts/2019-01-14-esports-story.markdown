In this decade, smaller sports and recreational activities have taken over America as big name sports associations like the National Football League and the National Basketball Association slowly reel more and more players into their real life game. Despite the immense amount of athletes in the world, there is now a competitive gaming universe taking the world by storm. This is known as the Esports revolution.

Out of the 7.5 billion people on the planet, 2.2 billion play games every day on their PC, MAC or other gaming devices, making up one third of the world's population. Now with enough money and competitors, electronic sports or Esports leagues and tournaments are becoming a worldwide phenomenon that take place all over the globe. Both older and younger generations are taking part in these leagues and tournaments, including Mt. Lebanon junior Valeiry Boystov who started playing video games at the age of 6, gravitating towards competitively-played games like CS:GO and Fortnite.

“First, when I was young, around 6 years old, I was just playing Counter Strike 1.6 for fun. Then at the age of 13, I figured out that Counter Strike became a competitive game and that people have teams,” Boystov said. “They travel around the world, and I got so hyped that I started playing on the special platform, ESEA, which is an Esports competitive video gaming online league and community founded by E-Sports Entertainment Association.”

With many new leagues like the Overwatch League and the Electronic Sports League, the popularity of Esports has grown to be very attractive to gamers around the world. Not only are they in it for the thought of playing the game they love for a living, but gamers who participate can make a large sum of money just by winning and competing in their respective competitions. The higher tier team you are on, the more cash that will be in your pocket.

“If you are just playing in a tier three to four team you earn one to $5,000 a month, and if you are in the top 20 teams you earn from $15,000 to $25,000,” Boystov explained. 
Esports works just like the NFL and other professional contracts. Teams in different gaming leagues will offer contracts to gamers to play on their respective team, take part in competitions and also sponsor the team. Some teams can make up to $18 million from tournament prize money like Fnatic and Team Liquid. Team Liquid is one of the most successful Esports teams and is home to Boystov’s role model who just signed a contract with the team.

“One of [my role models] would be Stewie2k. His real name is Jackie Yip,” Boystov said. “He’s only 18 and got recruited into Cloud9, an Esports organization, and Team Liquid had just signed a contract with him.”

No matter the age of the player, anyone can hop into the Esports world and try to compete against others for excitement and money. Esports has become very competitive with spots on teams being very hard to come by. It takes a lot of hard work and concentration, and the fact that some of these events take place on TV and in front of 100,000 people stuffed into an arena to watch is no easy feat. All of these Esports events can be streamed on websites, watched on TV or watched from convention centers or large arenas. Esports is taking the world by storm one step at a time, especially with more and more fans and players wanting to participate.
“Personally to me, Esports is a rapidly growing industry with millions of fans worldwide that support certain teams,” Boystov said. “The streaming service Twitch had transferred these people from basic gamers into superstars who can now earn millions.”

The Esports industry is only going to get more popular with technology changing every day and also opportunities opening up in both new games and leagues. With round robin and different style tournaments, it opens up more chances to win money and make a statement in the gaming world. The concentration, skill and fun of Esports is what is making it sweep the nation, and maybe a little bit of luck at the same time.
