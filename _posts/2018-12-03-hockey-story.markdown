As snowflakes start to fall on the winter scene, pucks are being dropped on ice rinks all over the country, but all eyes will be on the Mt. Lebanon hockey team as their season commences.

This year's team is not like any other as 16 seniors highlight Lebo Hockey this upcoming season. With the veteran presence, the team will look to continue their success and push for playoff appearances and titles. Senior Luke Husak is revved up for the upcoming season, a push for the postseason and other key young stars that have a lot to prove on the team, but this year’s schedule is not a walk in the park.

“I think [our schedule] is hard, [since] every team is just as good as the others,” Husak said. “Even though the teams are good, I think we have the speed and skill to beat those teams.”

Tough teams, including Central Catholic and Peters Township, highlight the Blue Devil’s schedule this season, with many other huge games scattered across the season. All the seniors are looking forward to these games, but they have to take it one step at a time.

“The main focus is to play hard every game and be consistent,” Husak said.

Being consistent will have to be a huge key for the Blue Devils this season, especially with them being in a competitive division and playing tough gritty opponents. The senior presence on the team, though, will look to have an impact on the underclassmen and preparing for their heavyweight division games coming up. Senior Anthony Sandora thinks that this senior experience will have an immediate impact on the younger players.

“Having a lot of experience really helps out the younger guys on the team to learn more and perform at higher levels,” Sandora said.

Seniors headline this season's Blue Devils team and the veteran players like Husak and Sandora are pushing these underclassmen and are getting them prepared for their future and the future of the Lebo hockey organization. Once these seniors depart, it’s up to the underclassmen to keep the legacy going on and off the ice.

“The underclassmen are the future of Lebo Hockey,” Husak said. “Once we leave, they need to start right where we left off.”

These seniors are not only getting these underclassmen adapted to the varsity level, they are targeting the top teams in the league and are still focusing on the task at hand. That task  is hoisting a championship at the end of the season, and this team believes that they can do so.

“We have a great group of guys full of skill and speed,” Sandora said. “We are all hungry to win this year.”

Sandora believes that if the team as a whole cooperates, goes out on the ice and puts an amazing performance together, they could be fighting for a title when spring rolls around. Fans should keep a keen eye out for this Blue Devil squad this season, which will look to put its name in the history books.

“Students and fans should look out for us possibly making a deep playoff run and maybe a Pens Cup,” Husak said. “Our team is full of seniors, and I believe this is our year.”

An exciting season is on tap for the next few months as fans and students should be packing the rink every game day to cheer on the players in what could be a special year brewing in Mt. Lebanon. These players will be giving it their all every game from here on out. They will continue to pedal down victory road and bumps in that road are not worrying Husak and the rest of the team.

“Even if we don’t get the outcome we want all the time, we still strive to be better. If we do that, we will have a successful season,” Husak said.

Despite the season ahead of the seniors, some are thinking about taking their talents to the next level. College hockey has become a possibility for seniors leaving the program. Whether it is Division I, Division II, Juniors or club level, they will look for any chance they can get to continue to play the sport they love. The problem is, hockey has many different recruiting rules and regulations that other sports, like football and baseball, do not have.

“Hockey recruiting is a little different compared to other sports, but I have thought of playing after high school,” Sandora said.

Even though college is right around the corner for these seniors, the number one thing on their plate right now is making the school proud and making headlines by going to the playoffs or even to the championship. It will take a lot of excruciating hours and headline games, but in the end, the Blue Devils hope to have an amazing season, no matter what the outcome is. These seniors, along the season’ s winding path, will continue to help these underclassmen in becoming the next step of Lebo hockey.

“The large amount of seniors provides younger players with leadership, and we act as mentors to them,” Husak said. “There are a lot of leaders on this team.”
