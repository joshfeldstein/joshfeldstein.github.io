It’s safe to say that the best part of the year is commencing as many sports in Mt. Lebanon and on the national level are starting to move into full swing. Football, soccer, field hockey, cross country, women’s tennis and women’s volleyball are all underway as Lebo looks to bring some more WPIAL Championships home this upcoming season. 

Some teams will be taking on new schools from across the county while the football, soccer, field hockey, women's tennis and volleyball teams take on long-time rival and neighbor Upper St. Clair. Players are also looking to make a name for themselves this year and trying to push to get scholarships for their respective sport. Each team’s quest for a championship has begun.

Following a 38-14 home loss to North Allegheny in the first round of the WPIAL playoffs last season, the football team will look to come back better and stronger with head coach Mike Melnyk. Although last year’s stars like Aidan Cain and Colby Sorsdal have left to go play college football, many open spots are up for grabs, especially for current seniors and juniors and even sophomores and freshman playing on varsity. This includes junior fullback Nick Maloney who is expecting big things this upcoming season.

“I’m trying to prove that I’m willing to put in the hard work that is necessary to compete at the varsity level, do whatever I can to help the team and to always have my teammates’ backs,” Maloney said.

Mt. Lebanon has a tougher schedule this year in comparison to last year as they face Gateway, Central Catholic, Pine-Richland, North Allegheny and of course Upper St. Clair. Having these tough games is the perfect way to show how much potential this football program could have going forward, and pulling out wins against a big name team like Central Catholic on their home turf or USC on ours would make KDKA nightly news any day. But they need to take it one step at a time and focus on one game at a time.

“I think every game is a chance to prove how well you’re team performs as a unit,” Maloney said. “We get to show our mentality which shows how dedicated we are to the game.”

Another playoff appearance for the Blue Devils is expected, but playing in the same division as Seneca Valley, Central Catholic and Pine-Richland is not a walk in the park. This team of guys could definitely put together a magical season if all of the puzzle pieces fit together. 

“You should expect us to have a good season full of swagger and discipline,” Maloney said.

Just like football, varsity boys soccer also has their fair share of tough matchups and big expectations this season as Head Coach William Perz and the rest of the staff look to put together a great team with a lot of opportunity. Junior Liam Donald thinks that the soccer team could surprise a lot of people and make some headline plays this season.

“We have a good deal of talent this year and a lot of depth,” Donald said. “There is a good mix of upper and underclassmen that bring a lot of energy to the field.”

The team this year has many big standout rivalry games against Upper St. Clair, Bethel Park and Peters Township. These rivalry games should get the team fired up, but they also have to focus on the games beforehand. 

“The coaches and captains do a good job at keeping us focused on the game plan and minimizing those factors out of our control,” Donald said.

The women's tennis have also already had several matches. They are lead by head coach Paul Skrok and look to pick up where they left off last year with another great season. Junior Megan Vujevich explained what to look forward to in the upcoming tennis season.

“Since it’s my first time on varsity, I’m just looking forward to the experience of it all, especially the matches and tournaments,” Vujevich said.

The team has several key matchups to look out for during the season including games at home against Baldwin and Pine-Richland and games at Upper St. Clair and Bethel Park. They also have several selected dates for section doubles and section singles.

“We have a lot of matches leading up [to sectional singles and doubles] that prepare us,” Vujevich said. “We make sure to work on things we need to do so that we don’t mess that up in the important matches.”

Cross-country also has some key meets and events coming up including the PIAA Foundation Meet in Hershey, Pennsylvania, the Meet of Legends and of course WPIAL Finals in October. Senior cross-country runner Steve Deme thinks that Mt. Lebanon has many good runners heading into the season and believes that more athletes could have the chance to finish the year off strong.

“I think we have many talented runners on our team, and that we will perform very well,” Deme said. “Our expectations are high as always, but I feel like we could live up to them and have our best season yet.”	

The field hockey team’s season has also started, and they have a pretty tough schedule coming up with games against Taylor Allderdice, Upper St. Clair and Fox Chapel. They will try and pick up some big wins this season and hope for high performance from all the players on their current roster. Junior Sarah Bolt expects big things from the team this season.

“So far everyone has been putting in a ton of work with really great energy,” Bolt said. “I expect us to have a really successful season with a lot of wins.”

The last major fall sport commencing this past month is the women’s volleyball team who has some big games this season at home against Peters Township, Upper St. Clair and Bethel Park and have a lot of veteran junior and senior presence on the roster. This includes junior Caroline Kovalan who is very excited to start another volleyball season 

“So far we have only won one game out of five, but we have been playing hard, and they have all been close games,” Kovalan said. “I think pretty soon there will be a turn, and we’ll start winning more, hopefully enough to go to WPIALS.”

Fall sports are underway in western PA as the football, soccer, women's tennis, cross country, field hockey and women’s volleyball teams look to bring home big wins this upcoming season. Now we just have to sit back in the Devil’s Den and cheer them on through thick and thin.
