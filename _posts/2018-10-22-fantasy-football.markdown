The leaves are starting to fall and so are friendships due to it now being fantasy football season.

With the start of the 2018-19 National Football League season, millions of avid football watchers around the world go head to head against close friends and family while playing fantasy football. Leagues can go from as little as four teams to 20 teams or more. 

Fans and football watchers alike all have different ways and reasons for playing fantasy football whether it is just for fun, beating close friends or winning the possible cash pool. Junior Liam Tatomir plays because it impacts how he watches football.

“I play fantasy football because it adds a new element of fun and competition when I am watching football games,” Tatomir said.

Learning about the NFL and all of the superstars and teams it has to offer is a big reason why fantasy football is so big around the country. Even players in the NFL are in fantasy football leagues drafting teammates, including their arch rivals.

English teacher Brad Kavo is involved in a fantasy league with his fellow Mt. Lebanon High School teachers. The league includes nine other teachers in the school. Kavo is trying to claim the top spot in a highly competitive fantasy league for the third time in the last six years.

“We have 10 teams in the league,” Kavo said. “In the last five years, I have won the championship twice.”

One big tip for drafting is always take a running back or a wide receiver in the first round, not worrying about taking a quarterback, but rather more about selecting a big name playmaker like Antonio Brown, Todd Gurley, Julio Jones or David Johnson.

“My first round pick was Devonta Freeman, and I was the fifth pick in my draft,” Kavo said. “Some others guys I drafted were Jay Ajayi, Larry Fitzgerald and Amari Cooper.”

Based on Kavo’s picks, he made the right moves in the draft, but injuries are the reason why his team is not doing so hot. In a draft, participants tend to select anywhere from 14-16 players and must select a team’s defense and a kicker. After a few days, the leagues waiver wire will become available and trades are allowed. Most players believe trading early in the season is not a particularly a good idea though; making a trade anywhere from week one to week six could easily break your team. Kavo doesn’t even trade at all.

“We don’t do many trades [in our league], we pretty much live and die by draft and waiver wire,” Kavo said. “I have a fear that if I give someone away now, they will start performing.”

Although some names that should be traded or dropped now would be running backs like Alex Collins and Royce Freeman who are now getting less snaps due to the emergence of other starters. Collins and Freeman are just a handful of names you could sell high or low right now. Junior Grant Smith has experienced some drafting setbacks this year especially with Freeman who has been outshined the past few weeks by Phillip Lindsay. 

“Broncos running back Royce Freeman has not had as good of a rookie season as expected,” Smith said. “I had him on both teams and already dropped him in one league.”

Some players who have been the subject of trade talk the past few weeks in some leagues are Tyler Boyd, David Johnson and Jared Cook who are all getting more targets on average teams and have made a big impact on the field the past few weeks. For example junior Liam Tatomir pulled the trigger on acquiring tight end Jared Cook for a cheap price.

“I traded Geronimo Allison for Jared Cook, one of the best tight ends in the league right now, and it has helped my team out a lot,” Tatomir said.

Then there is the “waiver wire” which is the select place in each fantasy league where players can pick up players not drafted onto a team after the draft is over. The waivers are only open to add between Wednesday-Saturday. The top players on the waiver wire according to ESPN headed into the next few weeks are Tyrell Williams, Mitch Trubisky, Jameis Winston and Marlon Mack, but before you add or drop anyone make sure to double check that they may have trade value or you will regret dropping them.

“My best waiver wire pickup was Tyler Boyd,” Tatomir said. “Over the past three to four games he has been putting up big numbers.”

Also a popular term for underrated players in fantasy football is known as a sleeper. Sleeper players are players almost always stashed somewhere in the waiver wire and are not owned in many leagues. These guys can help rosters in many ways especially if a player gets injured or another one loses snaps.

“[A sleeper is] someone that most people don’t have confidence in [but] that some people take pride in,” Kavo said. “People boast on sleeper picks. It’s almost like you are a real scout that you pick up on something others don’t.”

Some current examples of possible sleepers would be small name players like Chester Rogers and Wendell Smallwood who are both owned in a small percent of fantasy leagues. These players listed above are backup plans just in case other players on your team are underperforming.

“With all the injuries at running back the Eagles have had, both Wendell Smallwood and Corey Clement could both be good sleeper pickups,” Smith said.

Winning a fantasy football league is no easy task. Having a 13-week regular season and a four week playoff schedule takes a lot of time and effort but according to Smith it makes the season worthwhile.

“It’s fun to keep track of how good players are doing, to beat friends and to try and win the whole league,” Smith said.
