Dangling on a rope over cliffs. Mountains, and towns seems like an astronomical feat for even the bravest souls, but for former Mt. Lebanon student Finley Conway, he soaks in the thrill and challenge that comes with slack lining.

Slacklining is a tough hobby to pick up, especially since you are balancing all of your body weight on one rope tied from one point to another. All of your weight, strength, and resilience lies on a two inch wide rope that scales across vast cliffs, valleys, and rivers. Slacklining for Conway on the other hand is nothing but a breeze and safety is a number one priority.

“On these highlines you are always harnessed in,” Conway stated. “There is an enormous amount of safety and planning that goes into it.  I fall all the time and it is totally fine.”

In the world of slackline, the climbers must be willing to put forth the effort and practice to balance on the small rope; it is a hobby that involves an immense amount of risk and skill. In Finley’s mind though he would not consider himself a risk taker in any way.

“I do not think so, people think that I am insane for doing what I do but they do not understand, the process is completely safe,” Conway stated.

Before Conway got to take his slackline skill to extreme heights, he had to learn the basics of the hobby. He got help from peers, teachers, and coaches to lead him through a long journey ahead so it would all pay off in the end.

“When I first got into it I was at camp,” Conway said. “There was a counselor there who I looked up to a lot, and he taught me the basics.”

From then on he started to master slacklining and eventually became a counselor at that exact same camp.  Conway then began teaching other people who wanted to master it. He went from the mentored to the mentor.

“Eventually I became a counselor at the same camp, so I taught slacklining, this gave me lots of exposure to it and made me a lot better,” Conway said.

Conway just kept getting better at the sport and was now able to do over the top stunts and tricks and at higher points as well. He could now scale from mountain to mountain and ridge to ridge. He was taking it to the next level.

“The craziest one[stunt] I have been on was in West Virginia,” Conway said. “It was rigged in between two huge cliffs, and spanned 400 feet.”

Despite these stunts being tough, Conway, through hard work and perseverance, was able to complete these slackline tricks at higher locations and taught people how to balance in the clouds. He also looks to expand the slackline community to younger generations to come.

“I have been working on this[getting people involved] through the Pitt Outdoors Club,” Conway said.”I created a slackline chair for the club, and petitioned the student government board to give us some funding.”

Conway, with some help, reached out to the University of Pittsburgh, where he attends college as an Economics major, to establish a slackline type club. He also hopes as the years go by, slacklining becomes more popular and that more curious thrill seekers will give it a try. Finley also tries to recruit new people as much as possible and offer advice to people interested in the hobby. Here is some of his advice on slacklining: 

“Go for it,” Conway stated. “And mostly do not give up, the more times you fall the better you will get. Try to stay positive and focus on the improvements you are making rather than the failures.”

It was a long journey for Finley to become the slackline master he is today but there are more opportunities out there for Conway to scale new heights and higher mountains. Even though it took a lot of extra practice and commitment, Conway's unique hobby is one that he hopes will expand moving forward.
