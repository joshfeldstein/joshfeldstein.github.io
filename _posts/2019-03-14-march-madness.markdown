Unlike the Super Bowl, Stanley Cup Final or World Series, no sports playoff has the implications and money on the line like NCAA’s March Madness. Billions of people around the world fill out brackets every year to predict the winner of one sport’s most prestigious awards in the nation, the National Championship. 

From seeds one to 16, 68 different college teams placed in four different regions all have their eyes on the prize for the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament national title. 

From March 17 to April 8, the tournament will provide nonstop coverage to the hundreds of millions of viewers who cry for basketball and the chance to win some big bucks on their brackets. Though making a bracket doesn’t seem like a big deal, members of the NCAA March Madness Selection Committee go through thousands of different brackets every season.

Tom Burnett, the commissioner of the Southland Conference and member of the NCAA Selection Committee, explained that the process to make a bracket and decide what teams make the tournament is an extensive chain of events.

“During selection week, there may be more than 100 votes by the committee in order to get through the process,” Burnett said.

The Selection Committee has 10 members who throughout the year help determine what NCAA teams will make the field of 68 teams that make the tournament. 32 teams automatically qualify for the tournament by winning their conference, which leaves 36 spots for at-large teams that will be placed elsewhere in the tournament bracket. The lowest an at large seed can be is a 12 seed and the last four teams that get an at-large bid will play in the First Four in Dayton, Ohio. Deciding these bubble teams is a huge decision for Burnett and the rest of the Selection Committee.

“When the committee meets during selection week, this year beginning March 13, each of the 10 members will select the 36 best at-large teams, then the 32 automatic qualifiers will be added for the total field of 68 teams,” Burnett said. “The committee will then develop what it calls the overall seed list, ranking the teams one through 68.”

Sixty-eight teams and one champion seems like a stretch, but the magic of March Madness is all about sleeper teams winning the tournament and “Cinderella” teams making a run for it all.

To make each region in the bracket have equal strengths and weaknesses, they develop the overall seed list, Burnett explained, and try and space out the top four seeds equally.

“Each of the four brackets must balance within a preset standard on the first four seed lines, one through four,” Burnett said. “Adding the overall seed list numbers of the top 16 overall seeds in a region are compared with the other three regions.”

Burnett further explained the Selection Committee's strategy of adding the overall seed numbers in each region to make them equally competitive and thrilling to watch. 

“If one region has the following overall tournament seeds as its first four seeds: one, six, 10, 13, that equals 31 total,” Burnett said. “The other three regions should normally be within five, such as the following overall seeds in another region: two, eight, 10, 12, that equals 32, so within the five-point margin.”

The tools that the committee uses to make each bracket for each region helps make them have unique teams and matchups from a competitive standpoint. Also, they do not want teams playing close to their home court or even at their home court, which has been an issue in past brackets.

These intriguing matchups will draw a big market for college basketball, and in general, March Madness is one of the most watched sporting events. No matter the location of college, all are interested in the brackets and teams.

“I think we have a great game that has nationwide, even worldwide appeal as is evident with the attention the NCAA Tournament attracts leading up to the event and through the Final Four,” Burnett said. “I’d say every market is a big market for college basketball.”

With teams emerging in skill and attendance like Missouri, Arizona State and Tennessee, these markets for college basketball are only going to get bigger. The more popular cities get when it comes to college basketball, the higher the chance that these cities could attract more national attention from big name broadcasting stations like ESPN, CBS and FOX.

The honor of making the selection committee is an accomplished achievement and Burnett has the privilege to work as the commissioner of the Southland Conference. Becoming a member of the committee takes a lot of hard work and time involved with college athletics.

“Numerous nominations are submitted to other NCAA committees and councils charged with populating committees such as this one,” Burnett said. “Considerations are made for professional experience, diversity, regional representation and divisional designations within the NCAA structure.”

Burnett and the rest of the committee, including Bernard Muir, the athletic director of Stanford, and Mitch Barnhart, the athletic director of Kentucky, have to make sure that they have the correct bracket moving forward and the correct teams in the field of 68 that deserve to make the tournament. Burnett is grateful for his opportunity to be a part of this yearly process where they decide who will contend for the national title. The madness is only getting started for Burnett and the March Madness Selection Committee. 

“It’s a great honor and privilege to serve on the committee and have direct involvement with one of the world’s greatest sporting events,” Burnett said.
