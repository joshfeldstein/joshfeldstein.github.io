Years of drunkenness and excess took its toll on former Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel as his years of heavy usage of alcohol compromised his football career. Manziel recently explained his behavior to the public, revealing his diagnosis of bipolar disorder. This condition alters mood and reality itself making the patient feel moments of severe depression, anxiety, mood swings and experience occasional mental breakdowns.

Like Manziel, many former and current athletes are silently suffering from mental illness. Sports superstars like center Rick Rypien and tight end Aaron Hernandez both hid secrets regarding their mental health. Rypien was a professional hockey player for the Vancouver Canucks who helped lead them to a first place record of 54-19-9 during the 2010-2011 season, occasionally taking mental breaks throughout the season. Rypien suffered from severe depression and anxiety, leading to his suicide on Aug. 15, 2011 at 27.
	
Aaron Hernandez was a troublemaker through college at the University of Florida. He was drafted by the New England Patriots in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL Draft, where he spent time backing up Rob Gronkowski. Hernandez ultimately hung himself in prison following his life sentence for murder.

His autopsy found that he had the worst case of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, commonly known as CTE, ever discovered in an NFL player. CTE is a condition found primrily in football players with symptoms consisting of paranoia, anxiety, depression, loneliness and other severe symptoms. Severe trauma to the head has been linked to several lethal conditions along with symptoms that surface before death. Unfortunately, the disease cannot be officially diagnosed until an autopsy of the brain is performed. 

Thomas Dietrich, an emergency room physician from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, believes that CTE illness is caused by constant trauma to the head and other parts of the body, including the spine and neck areas.

“It goes back to brain damage. Old people have the same problems,” Dietrich said. ”It all goes back to CTE, which all leads to mental illnesses along with anxiety and depression.”
CTE is a condition found mainly in football players with symptoms consisting of paranoia, anxiety, depression, loneliness and other severe conditions. Unfortunately, the disease cannot be officially diagnosed until an autopsy of the brain is performed. The major issue is that doctors and major hospitals need more research and effort to find out what CTE actually is and why it is leading to long term issues like dementia and other mental illnesses. 

“We don’t know why people with mainly football backgrounds are getting dementia,” Dietrich said. “Repetitive head injuries destroy the cells and receptors in the brain, which leads to memory damage and other big issues.”

Many professional players don’t understand the risk of playing competitive professional football.  Many collegiate and NFL players need to start realizing how serious too many hits to the head can be for the human body along with their health and wellness.

“In the pros, you’ve got to weigh out your options between millions of dollars or risking your life playing the sport you love,” Dietrich said.

According to Dietrich, there is a simple way to prevent more cases of CTE. Getting rid of hard helmets and replacing them with leather and artificial caps could slow down concussion rates. 

“I believe the NFL should get rid of helmets completely,” Dietrich said. “There were less concussions back in the day with leather and no helmets, rugby has a a lot less head injuries than football and it is because of them not having helmets.”

The most common mental disease that has been linked to head injuries the past few years are mainly dementia and bipolar disorder, but several symptoms are almost going unnoticed. Depression has been setting in to many former and current athletes young atletes. Junior Seau, an NFL Hall of Famer, became depressed and committed suicide at 43 due to too much head trauma. His condition went unidentified for years after he retired from football although family members noticed strange behavior including memory loss, mood swings, and paranoia. Seau’s mother Luisa Mauga Seau spoke out after her son’s death on May 2, 2012 with just five emotional words.

“Take me, not my son,” Seau’s mother said.

There is still mystery surrounding CTE and other mental illnesses' connection to severe head and brain trauma, but as more and more athletes suffer from concussions, the more information we are finding about the lethal conditions. Mt. Lebanon high school algebra teacher Ben Erdeljac, who played college football at Duke, spoke out about the recent concussion issues.

“I think it is important that the players understand the risks however, when you are a young talented athlete,” Erdeljac stated,” it is very hard to have an appropriate perspective on what you are risking.” 

Young players like Hernandez and Robinson didn’t have the perspective Erdeljac did on the game of football. Erdeljac knew when it was time to stop playing unlike Aaron Hernandez and other players.

“When you are young you think you are invincible, although some of the responsibility does fall on the organizations like the NCAA, NFL, FIFA [and] WPIAL” Erdeljac said. 

Rules need to be changed to ensure maximum safety of players, but even safety violation rules or changes won’t completely stop these head injuries. The target zone is shrinking on defenseless receivers and runners. Back when Mel Blount and Jack Lambert played, football was a free for all. Now players are forced to hit in certain areas with the risk of being penalized or even suspended due to new rules and league violations.

“I think there will be more examination of the rules to try and prevent head injuries and provide proper diagnosis,” Erdeljac said.  "Whether this will result in actual rule changes in the game will be for the future.”

The NFL and NCAA know the risks of the game and that they are putting these athletes in sometimes violent situations.  Youth football has shrunk as well in the recent years with only dedicated and future youth athletes playing the sport.

“My son Luke, who is 6, is very interested in running routes and catching the ball in the backyard,” Erdeljac said. “Right now, I’m not encouraging them, but I don’t discourage their interest in the game. It is a very physical and sometimes violent game.”

The game is physical but the NFL Player’s Association and NCAA can’t just eliminate the hard nature of the sport. There is still a lot of research to be done involving CTE and other chronic brain injuries but one thing is for certain:  the games of football, hockey, and soccer will one day be changed for the better, one step at a time.
