Sixteen teams. One champion. The fight for the Stanley Cup has officially begun as each conference’s top eight teams will compete for a spot in the 2019 Stanley Cup Final, possibly having the chance to make history.

As the regular season closes out, the 2019 NHL Playoffs are ready to commence as big name teams like the Tampa Bay Lightning, Nashville Predators and Pittsburgh Penguins look to prove themselves as Cup favorites, while others look to be spoilers. From April to June, the 16 teams who qualify for the playoffs will take place in best-of-seven game series where the first to four wins in the series advances to the next round. There are four rounds en route to a Stanley Cup Championship: The conference quarterfinals, semifinals, conference finals and the Stanley Cup Final.

Seniors Max Dewit and Shane Gannon and junior Adam Miller will make their predictions for this year’s NHL postseason and also MVP predictions. This year’s playoffs will either be a complete toss up or one team will run away with the championship, especially with many dangerous teams in the mix. Who is the most dangerous team in the NHL?

“Right now I got to say the Lightning,” Dewit said. “They’ve just dominated all season and won the President’s Trophy so early, and they show no signs of slowing down and have been so consistent.”

The Tampa Bay Lighting is the clear favorite as of right now to take home only their second Stanley Cup in franchise history, especially with MVP candidates Nikita Kucherov and Steven Stamkos leading the charge. Despite the Lightning possibly running away with the Cup, many other sleeper teams will look to make a name for themselves like the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference.

“[I’d say] Carolina [since]they are underrated and have a lot of underrated players as well,” Miller said.

Led by young players like Sebastian Aho, Teuvo Teravainen and Jaccob Slavin, the Carolina Hurricanes are a team to keep an eye on. They will take on the Washington Capitals in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs as the ‘Canes make the postseason for the first time since 2009.

According to Dewit, though, the Hurricanes aren’t the only team to look out for in the playoffs this year.

“Another sleeper [team] could be Dallas,” Dewit said. “Ben Bishop was playing solid before his injury, and they still have Mats Zuccarello coming back. When healthy, they’re dangerous.”

Whether it be the Dallas Stars or the New York Islanders making a deep run in the playoffs, the best thing about the NHL playoffs is that any team can make a run for a championship. Many headline players will also be on the big stage for the first time this season like many stars from the Calgary Flames and the Columbus Blue Jackets, small market teams not often nationally televised.

Many MVP candidates will also be on tap in the playoffs, and right now, the MVP race is not even close as one Tampa Bay superstar continues to rack up point after point.

“I’d say Nikita Kucherov [could win MVP],” Miller said. “His scoring ability is unmatched this year. I know it’s mostly assists, but he is a good goal scorer.” 

Kucherov’s amazing season has included a total of 41 goals and 87 assists(128 points) as the surging Tampa Bay Lightning stand as the current favorites to take home the Stanley Cup. Kucherov isn’t the only Lightning player making big name plays, especially with all-star Steven Stamkos and top three defenseman Victor Hedman.

Despite the Lightning leading the NHL in pretty much every stats category, another top tier team with heavy playoff experience will not go down without a fight.

“Though super inconsistent this regular season, the Pens still show signs of being that great playoff team,” Dewit said. “As long as everyone is healthy, I think the Pens could make a decent run.”

With Sidney Crosby leading the Pittsburgh Penguins to yet another postseason, 13 straight seasons to be exact, the Pens will look to win their third Stanley Cup Championship in four seasons. The Penguins were eliminated in the second round by their rival the Washington Capitals last season after winning back-to-back titles in 2016 and 2017. The Penguins will for sure make this year’s Stanley Cup Final a toss up, along with the other sleeper teams named before.

“If I would have to put money on it, I would probably say Pens and San Jose,” Dewit said. “With the return of Erik Karlsson, the Sharks could be deadly. Maybe the Flames though too, it’s really up in the air.”

The San Jose Sharks have one of the top defensive pairings in the NHL, led by all-stars Brent Burns and Erik Karlsson(Karlsson was acquired in an offseason blockbuster trade with the Ottawa Senators).

The Sharks and Flames are two top candidates to take the West and both happen to be in the Pacific Division. One of those two teams could be out as late as the first or second round.

The Stanley Cup Championship could either go to a very experienced team or even one that is making the playoffs for the first time in several years. This year’s postseason will be one to remember, but the 2019 Stanley Cup Champion will be…

“Tampa is my pick,” Gannon said. “They are one hell of a team this year, their fluidity and style of play is impressive and something that you rarely see, they have the drive, and they can do it.”
